    "The VADER lexicon, developed by C.J. Hutto, is a lexicon that is based on a rule-based sentiment analysis framework, specifically tuned to analyze sentiments in social media. VADER stands for Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner.The file titled vader_lexicon.txt contains necessary sentiment scores associated with words, emoticons and slangs (like wtf, lol, nah, and so on). There were a total of over 9,000 lexical features from which over 7,500 curated lexical features were finally selected in the lexicon with proper validated valence scores. Each feature was rated on a scale from \"[-4] Extremely Negative\" to \"[4] Extremely Positive\", with allowance for \"[0] Neutral (or Neither, N/A)\". The process of selecting lexical features was done by keeping all features that had a non-zero mean rating and whose standard deviation was less than 2.5, which was determined by the aggregate of ten independent raters."
